# P4SBU Smart Parking System
## Team SBU01
This project is a web-based smart parking management system for Stony Brook University. It features a React frontend and a Node.js/Express backend that connects to two databases:
- **MongoDB**: A remote database (e.g., via MongoDB Atlas) for storing core application data such as Users, ParkingLots, ParkingSpots, Reservations, Payments, OTPs, Feedback, and OccupancyHistory.
- **Neo4j**: A graph database for managing campus map data and supporting wayfinding queries. *(Note: The current Neo4j driver integration is under development and may have authentication issues that will be resolved in future updates.)*

> **Note:**  
> This project uses a `.env` file for environment configuration. For production, you should remove sensitive data from your repository and set environment variables using your hosting platformâ€™s configuration tools.
